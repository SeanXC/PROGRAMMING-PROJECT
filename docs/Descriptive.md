This class is pretty basic at this stage - I will add other methods as they are requested.

- **largest** takes an array of type float as a parameter and outputs the largest value in that array.
- **smallest** takes an array of type float as a parameter and outputs the smallest value in that array.
- **mean** takes an array of type float as a parameter and outputs the mean of that array.
- **median** takes an array of type float as a parameter and outputs the middle value of that array.
- **mode** takes an array of type float as a parameter and outputs the most common value in that array (if the array is multimodal, it will return the first most common value).
